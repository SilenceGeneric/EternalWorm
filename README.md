# README for Malicious Email Script

## Description
This Python script simulates a malicious email delivery attack that sends an email containing a fake PDF attachment with an embedded malicious payload. The email message appears to be from a trusted sender, prompting the recipient to open the attached document, which contains a hidden executable payload. The script is designed to simulate realistic email behavior, including random delays and email formatting.

**Note:** This script is for educational purposes only. It is crucial to use this responsibly in a controlled environment, such as a security training lab or penetration testing scenario, to demonstrate the risks of phishing and malware attacks.

## Features
- **Fake Email Generation:** Creates a fake email with a misleading subject and message body, making it appear as if it is a legitimate communication from a trusted source.
- **Fake PDF Attachment:** Attaches a fake PDF file that actually contains a base64-encoded malicious payload.
- **Malicious Payload Encoding:** Encodes the malicious payload to avoid detection by security software.
- **SMTP Email Sending:** Uses an SMTP server (Gmail in this case) to send the crafted email.
- **Simulated Execution:** Simulates the execution of the malicious payload on the recipient's machine (in a controlled, safe environment).

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure the following:
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- The following Python libraries must be installed:
  - `smtplib`
  - `email`
  - `base64`
  - `os`
  - `random`
  - `time`
  
You can install any missing dependencies with `pip`.

## Instructions

1. **Modify the Email Details:**
   - Set the `sender` and `recipient` email addresses at the top of the script to your desired values.
   - Replace the `payload_path` with the path to the malicious payload file you wish to encode (e.g., `.exe` or other executable file).
   
2. **Configure the SMTP Server:**
   - The script currently uses Gmail's SMTP server (`smtp.gmail.com` on port 587) for email delivery.
   - Ensure the sender's Gmail account is properly configured to allow SMTP connections.
   - Replace `'example_password'` with the actual password for the sender's Gmail account.

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Run the script by executing it in your terminal or Python environment.
   - The email will be sent to the recipient with the fake PDF attachment.

4. **Testing (Optional):**
   - The script includes a simulated payload execution (`os.system(payload_path)`), which should only be tested in a safe, isolated environment (e.g., virtual machines or sandboxes).

## Ethical Considerations
This script is for educational purposes to demonstrate the potential risks of phishing and email-based malware delivery. It is intended for use in controlled environments, such as penetration testing labs or cybersecurity training, and should never be used for malicious purposes. Always ensure you have proper consent before testing any scripts on live systems.

## Warning
Running this script outside a safe, controlled environment can be illegal and unethical. **Do not** send emails like this without explicit permission, as it can cause real harm to individuals and organizations.

## License
This script is licensed under the MIT License. Use it responsibly and ensure you are following local laws and ethical guidelines when conducting cybersecurity training or penetration testing.
